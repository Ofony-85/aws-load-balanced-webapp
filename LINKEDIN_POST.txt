🚀 Excited to share my latest AWS cloud infrastructure project!

I just built and deployed a production-ready, highly available web application on AWS with automatic load balancing across 3 EC2 servers.

🌐 Live Demo: http://webapp-alb-1764231315-1467904260.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
(Click refresh to see load balancing in action!)

🏗️ What I Built:
- 3 EC2 instances running across multiple availability zones
- Application Load Balancer handling traffic distribution
- Nginx reverse proxy + Flask Python backend
- Automated deployment using Infrastructure as Code
- Real-time health monitoring with auto-failover
- Complete security group configuration

💻 Technical Stack:
✅ AWS (EC2, Application Load Balancer, VPC, Security Groups)
✅ Amazon Linux 2023
✅ Python 3.9 + Flask framework
✅ Nginx web server
✅ Bash scripting for automation

🎯 Key Learning Outcomes:
→ Designed scalable, fault-tolerant cloud architectures
→ Implemented load balancing for high availability
→ Configured security groups and network isolation
→ Automated infrastructure deployment (IaC approach)
→ Managed Linux servers and systemd services
→ Set up health checks and monitoring

🔥 The Cool Part:
Every time you refresh the page, you might see a different server hostname - that's load balancing doing its magic! The ALB intelligently distributes traffic across healthy instances.

📊 Architecture Highlights:
- Multi-AZ deployment for resilience
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Automatic removal of unhealthy instances
- Round-robin traffic distribution
- Secure network segmentation
